      <label>Secure password locker.</label>

      <!-- Description -->
      <br /><expl>First project for General Assembly's UXDi program.</expl>
      <text>
	<br />This was the first project for the program. The goal was to interview a classmate to discover a problem that could be solved with a mobile app. My project partner had been wanting a simple place to store passwords that would reveal them without revealing the user name or the service at the same time. While there are a ton of password managers available, they are overkill for his needs. The basic idea was to be a glorified notepad that would also itself be locked.

      <!-- Summary -->
      <div class="summary"><label>Objective</label><br />Create a password-protected password manager app that allows easy reminder of username and password for various digital and physical services.</div>
      <div class="summary"><label>Outcome</label><br /><a href="https://popapp.in/w/projects/5391006780b5bdd132cb4c61/mockups/53910068f2c0c43d0364b605">Clickable paper prototype</a> of sketches for the app, along with basic error handling.</div>
      <div class="summary"><label>Occupation</label><br />User interviews, research, and testing. Pen-and-paper sketches, both low and high fidelity.</div>
      <div class="summary"><label>Outfit</label><br />POP App, online and on phone.</div>

      <br />
      <label>My Role</label>
      <text><br />I was lucky that my partner had a rather robust idea of what app he wanted, and basically just had to design it. However, I was able to bring my QA experience to the fore and created some error handling that otherwise might have been missed. There was also a lot of back-and-forth conversation about the look and feel of the paper prototype before the final sketches were photographed for PopApp.
	<br />The original idea had been simply a password-protected place to record usernames and passwords. This is insecure if someone is looking over your shoulder, so we decided to have a hold-to-reveal action for passwords instead. Allowances were also made for entering codes (locks, gates, etc) that have no associated username.
	<br />Interviews revealed other information that would be useful to have in such a locker, such as answers to security questions. However, the complex interactions required for not revealing usernames at the same time as any of the security information made this too difficult.
