			<text>
				<br />The SF Department of Public Works is in charge of all roadworks in the city, as well as any construction at libraries, the airport, and a number of other large projects. When a contractor bids on a job, their information is compared to historical data from past bids.
				<br />Currently, this information is kept on many spreadsheets across many computers across many departments within the DPW. Someone had an idea to put all of this information into a central database, and I was brought in to build/design the front end interface for it.

				<br />I was working on a webapp front end for data that was being manually entered into an SQL database. I focused on bringing it up to interaction standards and ensuring it fit within the larger DPW branding.
				<br />After presenting paper prototypes, I had a rudimentary front-end to some "dummy data" available for user testing. I convinced the stakeholders that user testing was actually important, and eventually managed a week of conversations with people who would be interacting with the database in a variety of ways.
				<br />Unfortunately, while I was in the process of pulling together a report of the user feedback, the project was canceled and my contract ended.

				<br />conduct user interviews and testing at all levels of the interaction chain (input, search, report generation, ...)
