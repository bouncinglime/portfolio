      <!-- Description -->
      <label>Summary</label>
      <text>
	<br />Highly-organized woman-in-tech looking for interesting puzzles to solve, especially in Service Design. My artistic upbringing instilled a keen eye for aesthetics and creative solutions, and I am now interested in turning those talents to creating efficient ways for people to move through spaces. Always willing to dig deeper to find the roots of problems, I bring a collection of abilities that open new perspectives, both globally and at the implementation level. I specialize in creative thinking and problem-solving, with a strong emphasis on accuracy and efficiency.

	<text>
	  <br />Looking for opportunities to use my skills to make a positive impact on the world. I am currently volunteering for I Am The Cavalry, a grassroots organization bringing together security researchers and manufacturers of devices with embedded computers to address the implications for human safety.
	  <br />As a short person, I stand on many soap boxes : access to education, climate change, medicine and vaccination, human rights, digital rights, intellectual property, the intersection of arts and technology, wilderness survival, outdoor exploration, experiential learning, music and dance, and how access to the arts will save humanity.
	  <br />I am hoping that my next move will take me in a direction to assist with positive, global, social change.
