			<label>Summary</label>
			<text>
				<br />Highly-organized woman-in-tech looking for interesting puzzles to solve that will make a positive impact on the world. My artistic upbringing instilled a keen eye for aesthetics and creative solutions, and I am now interested in turning those talents to creating efficient ways for people to move through spaces. Always willing to dig deeper to find the roots of problems, I bring a collection of abilities that open new perspectives, both globally and at the implementation level. I specialize in creative thinking and problem-solving, with a strong emphasis on accuracy and efficiency.
				<br />
				<br />I am hoping that my next move will take me in a direction to assist with positive, global, social change.
