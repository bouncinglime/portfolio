	<label>Cover Letter - Program Specialist</label>
	
      <text>
		<p>My parents are self-employed artists, and I have always been an "indentured servant" - involved in every aspect of running a business, from marketing to production to administrative duties. This detail-driven experience instilled a fascination with the inner workings of both devices and processes which, after four years of self-directed homeschooling, led me to a physics major. Frustrated with the stodgyness of academia, I found my way into software Quality Assurance. A blend of research, documentation, detail work, customer service, and system-building, I was able to wear all the hats I liked best.</p>

		<p>As the Retail Interaction Designer for Other Machine, Co., I was responsible for everything needed to get our web store up and running. I set up the underlying infrastructure (packaging, documentation, inventory, etc) in tandem with designing the store experience for customers (page layout, photography, information, etc). My systems for order fulfilment are still in use, and have scaled with the growth of the company.</p>

		<p>Process has always fascinated me, which has led to a lot of volunteer work. Currently, I am building the documentation for bringing new people on board at Sundown Blues - a non-profit that runs two weekly blues dance venues in SF and Berkeley. When we purchased the organization from the previous owner, there was nothing in place except institutional knowledge and word-of-mouth. In the year since then, we have expanded our community and have become known nationwide as one of the best places to learn blues dance in the country.</p>
		
		<p>Organization, documentation, analysis, and communication are the four pillars with which I support my constant quest for efficiency and accuracy in all things. I would be excited to put them to use for Autodesk, and to learn new variations in the process.</p>
		
		<p>Thank you for your time and consideration.
