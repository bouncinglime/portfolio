      <text>
		<p>Raised by artists, I developed an innate sense of both good and bad design before I understood the difference. Efficiency has always been my guiding principle, and my course with General Assembly gave me a new set of tools to assess and streamline everything I do.</p>

		<p>Working at Songbird, I learned about the full software development process and all of the processes it requires. Based on my feedback about our application, I ended working very closely with our designer. The more I learned about that field, the more interested I became. I grew up surrounded by an organic design process, but had never encountered the formal version. It seemed a natural extension of my experience of the world - most of what we encounter in our daily lives has been designed, and when done well it makes all the difference.</p>
		
		<p>As the Retail Interaction Designer for Other Machine, Co., I was responsible for everything needed to get our web store up and running. I set up the underlying infrastructure (packaging, documentation, inventory, etc) in tandem with designing the store experience for customers (page layout, photography, information, etc). My systems for order fulfilment are still in use, and have scaled with the growth of the company.</p>

		<p>I thrive in an environment which allows me to work closely with people involved in all aspects of a project. Having insight into the full system allows me to identify the details that are truly important, and generate end-to-end designs that address a client's core needs. Autodesk seems to also value and foster cross-collaboration in the interest of deeper understanding, which is what puts it high on my list of places I would like to work.</p>
		
		<p>Organization, documentation, analysis, and communication are the four pillars with which I support my constant quest for efficiency and accuracy in all things. I would be excited to put them to use for Autodesk, and to learn new variations in the process.</p>
		
		<p>Thank you for your time and consideration.
