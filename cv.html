					<br />Creating efficient, intuitive experiences.
					<br />
					<br />Highly-organized woman-in-tech looking for interesting puzzles to solve. My artistic upbringing instilled a keen eye for aesthetics and creative solutions, and I am now interested in turning those talents to creating efficient ways for people to move through spaces. Always willing to dig deeper to find the roots of problems, I bring a collection of abilities that open new perspectives, both globally and at the implementation level. I specialize in creative thinking and problem-solving, with a strong emphasis on accuracy and efficiency.

					<br />October 2014 - May 2015
					<br />Part-time contract doing graphic design and UX for an internal application. Currently, cost estimates for all DPW projects are created as spreadsheets with multiple versions saved on various computers. Some are printed, information filled out by another party, and then entered back into yet another document. Over the past two years, a centralized database of all of this project cost estimate data has been hand-built by several engineers to begin to simplify and digitize this process. I've been brought on board to design and build the web-based user interface for this database. So far, this has involved writing CSS and HTML, conducting user interviews, presenting and defending my ideas to higher-level administrators, and semi-patiently waiting for the gears of city bureaucracy to turn.
