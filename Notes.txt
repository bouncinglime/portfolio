				<br />Research and interviews allowed us to create two main personas - potential users and current users - that we wanted to target. Current users were the most important, per the brief and client conversations. However, we had come up with some ideas that could be used as marketing demos to show how easy it is to use the PowerReviews API.

				<br />At each step of the way, we asked users for feedback. Because neither of us are developers and were new to API interactions, this was absolutely critical; it was also helpful to not be as directly a potential user from the get-go. (By the end, though, we both wanted to have a reason to use it!)
				<br />It was extremely difficult to test the interactions, and we ended up mostly just explaining to users what would happen when they "clicked" on a certain area of the paper prototype. Next time, I would definitely want to use tracing paper or the like to demonstrate overlays and changes to only small portions of a screen.
