				<br />At each step of the way, we asked users for feedback. Because neither of us are developers and were new to API interactions, this was absolutely critical; it was also helpful to not be as directly a potential user from the get-go. (By the end, though, we both wanted to have a reason to use it!)
				<br />It was extremely difficult to test the interactions, and we ended up mostly just explaining to users what would happen when they "clicked" on a certain area of the paper prototype. Next time, I would definitely want to use tracing paper or the like to demonstrate overlays and changes to only small portions of a screen.
