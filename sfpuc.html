			<text>
				<br />The <a href="http://sfwater.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">San Francisco Public Utilities Commission</a> hired me on a part-time contract to design a new timekeeping module for tracking work hours logged against contracts. The current system was generally regarded as confusing, and didn't plug into the new contract tracking site.
				<br />The biggest constraints were the variety of reports that were needed, both ones that the current system generated and creating a new way to build ones that were current put together by individuals.

				<br />In a short part-time contract, I was able to pull together a very extensive clickable prototype to meet the PUC requirements. I was also able to conduct some user testing, which resulted in many positive comments.
				<br />Stakeholder conversations revealed more data types that were needed for various reports. These  happened during presentations, and I was able to make changes to the prototype on the spot. Where I couldn't, queries were raised with the development team about technical possibilities.

			<text>
				<br />As the sole designer, I was responsible for research, design, testing, presentation, and all other aspects of getting a clickable prototype ready for development work.
				<br />After understanding the boundaries of the project, I dove into market research and design standards to understand best practices for this type of interaction. I also conducted some limited user testing among co-workers, and eventually with stakeholders.
				<br />Along with the new site had come new branding, and  I was able to contribute to the design document that was still a living document.

			<text>
				<br />Because the design document was still in progress, my first task was to read it and clarify the bounds of the project. I ran through several thumbnail-sketch flows with my supervisor to ensure that we were on the same page.
				<br />Although the whole process was very seperate from the development ("waterfall" style), I made an effort to engage my supervisor in an Agile style - checking in almost every morning, walking through what I'd done that week, and working out a fairly accurate method of costing each step.
				<br />Towards the end of the project, I uncovered more requirements from other stakeholders who were not involved until some of the final design presentations. This was quite a surprise, and my ability to make notes and changes on the live prototype came in handy.
