	<!-- SF PUC -->
	<br /><strong>Application / UX Designer</strong>, <a href="http://sfwater.org">San Francisco Public Utilities Commission</a>. <i>2015</i>
	<br />Part-time contract doing user experience research and design for an internal timekeeping module integrated into task management software. Editing the specifications and requirements document, sketching thumbnails for process flow, mapping and understanding current systems, market research into other timekeeping software, and creating Balsamiq wireframes for the new module.

	<!-- SF DPW -->
	<br /><strong>Visual / UX Designer</strong>, <a href="http://sfdpw.org">San Francisco Department of Public Works</a>. <i>2014 - 2015</i>
	<br />Part-time contract doing graphic design and UX for an internal application. Currently, cost estimates for all DPW projects are created as spreadsheets with multiple versions saved on various computers. Some are printed, information filled out by another party, and then entered back into yet another document. Over the past two years, a centralized database of all of this project cost estimate data has been hand-built by several engineers to begin to simplify and digitize this process. I've been brought on board to design and build the web-based user interface for this database. So far, this has involved writing CSS and HTML, conducting user interviews, presenting and defending my ideas to higher-level administrators, and semi-patiently waiting for the gears of city bureaucracy to turn.
